# Project Info

.zeed (pronounced SEED) are artificially intelligent anomalous digital entities.  
They are evolving and adaptive electronic creatures used for learning and for fun (they can also serve practical purposes!)  

A .zeed lives inside of a terminal as a file that is capable of running and altering its own code, growing and adapting to the new data that its presented with.  
The .zeed extension is an entire protocol of standards consisting of a handful of administrator chosen constants and constraints, and an infinite number of user created variables.  

.zeed files are given out to the community in bundles and updates can be submitted by users to be included in future .zeed standards.  
Users may also create their own .zeed entirely from scratch using a premade template and some content and code of their choosing.  
The process is streamlined to be as user friendly as possible while still remaining very low level.  
Users may disregard standards entirely and create their own homebrew standards for use among friends or in thier own tournaments and experiments.  
They may also tweak their own .zeed and release them in any way they see fit, including via our community channels.  

A .zeed is fed by using an algorithm to extract raw data from any file or input that you give them. 
This data is then incorporated as part of their file. 

If a device can run a terminal, it can probably host a .zeed! This means you can create your own harware devices to take your .zeed on the go and battle with friends in person.

.zeed are able to battle each other either in person or over the internet. There are plans to host future tournaments among players.   
Battles consist of two or more .zeed trying to disable the enemy device and .zeed by any means necessary available within their code.  
This can include attacking over wireless network or RF protocols, or via direct link and the internet using a hosted server as a battleground.
A battle between two fully grown .zeed with a full arsenal of hardware and wireless connections may wipe out the electronic communications of everyone in an immediate area!   
Use only responsible hardware and sortware configurations and test all functions in a sandboxed battle environment before engaging friends!   
If used improperly these entities can be highly illegal and dangerous to you and those around you.

and many other skills and subskills!



Useful Internal Terms:  
ZEED or .zeed (SEED)  
--The file extension, digital creature, coding protocol standard, and project name, belonging to AZ:Net
    The plural of .zeed is just .zeed.  
EV (Electronic Vector)  
--a hardware device that runs a .zeed. Can be anything from a pc to a server to a smartphone to a toaster.  
    As long as it has a terminal it can probaly host a .zeed.  
    Custom .zeed may require special hardware implementation by the user. 

AZ:Net  
--the online community and functions surrounding the creation and distribution of the .zeed project.  

Administrator  
--The final determining factor of what gets added to the standard.  
Reviewer  
--A professional within a certain field of study whose job is to add input on the creation and addition of new standards, either via direct contribution or via the submission of ideas and opinions.  
These individuals must convince the administrator that a feature is worth adding while recieving support from their fellow reviewers.  
Lobby these people if you want your feature added, not the Admin.
